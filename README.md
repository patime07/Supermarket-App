# Supermarket-App

This repository contains a Java-based Supermarket Application project, by the course "[Java Object-Oriented Programming: Supermarket App](https://www.coursera.org/learn/java-oop-supermarket-app/home/week/1)" on Coursera.

The Supermarket App is a console-based application that I developed in Java, and whoch simulates a real life supermarket system, allowing users to manage products, process transactions, and handle customer interactions. The project is designed to demonstrate object-oriented programming (OOP) principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
